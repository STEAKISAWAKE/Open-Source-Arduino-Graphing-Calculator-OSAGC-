# Open-Source-Arduino-Graphing-Calculator-OSAGC
This is in-dev Arduino baced Calculator OS. I am still creating the schematics and everything so stay tuned. There will be many pieces going into the Open Source Arduino Graphing Calculator.

This project is going to be a calculator that will be able to show complex math equations by displaying them as a graph. There will still be normal math operations like a normal TI-83.
